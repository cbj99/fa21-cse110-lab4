### 1. It prints **3**. **var** variables have no block scope. Because it prints the value of **var i**, which is initialized with value 0 and added by 1 for 3 times.
&nbsp;
### 2. It prints **150**. **var** variables have no block scope. Because it prints the latest value of **var discountedPrice**, which is assigned a value of 300*(1-0.5) = 150 at line 7 in the loop above at the end.
&nbsp;
### 3. It prints **150**. **var** variables have no block scope. Because it prints the latest value of **var finalPrice**, which is assigned a value of (150*100)/100 = 150 at line 8 in the loop above at the end. The **Math.round()** function returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer, thus this line will round **var discountedPrice** to 2 decimal places.
&nbsp;
### 4. It returns an array: **[ 50, 100, 150 ]**. **var** variables have no block scope. We declare an empty array at line 3 and keep pushing the value of **var finalPrice** into it during each iteration of the loop. Since the discount is **0.5** and the initial price list is **[ 100, 200, 300 ]**, this function simply returns the new price list (price list for consumer) which is **[ 50, 100, 150 ]**.
&nbsp;
### 5. It returns a reference error. **let i** is declared inside of the for-loop block. **let** variables have block scope, thus it is not defined outside.
&nbsp;
### 6. It returns a reference error. **let discountedPrice** is declared inside of the for-loop block. **let** variables have block scope, thus it is not defined outside.
&nbsp;
### 7. It prints **150**. **let finalPrice** is declared outside of the for-loop block, thus it is defined in the block of the **discountPrices()** function. Thus it prints the latest value of **let finalPrice**, which is assigned a value of (150*100)/100 = 150 at line 8 in the loop above at the end.
&nbsp;
### 8. It returns an array: **[ 50, 100, 150 ]**. We declare an empty array at line 3 and keep pushing the value of **let finalPrice** into it during each iteration of the loop. Since the discount is **0.5** and the initial price list is **[ 100, 200, 300 ]**, this function simply returns the new price list (price list for consumer) which is **[ 50, 100, 150 ]**.
&nbsp;
### 9. It returns a reference error. **let i** is declared inside of the for-loop block. **let** variables have block scope, thus it is not defined outside.
&nbsp;
### 10. It prints **3**. It prints the value of **const length** which is assigned a value of 3 at line 10. Also, since it is a **const** type, its value will never change.
&nbsp;
### 11. It returns an array: **[ 50, 100, 150 ]**. The keyword **const** is a little misleading. It does NOT define a constant array. **It defines a constant reference to an array.** Because of this, we can still change the elements of a constant array. We declare an empty array at line 3 and keep pushing the value of **const discountedPrice** into it during each iteration of the loop.

### 13.
<ol type="A">
    <li> '32'. Here + stands for concatenation.
    <li> 1. Here '3' converts to 3 and does the subtraction: 3 - 2 = 1.
    <li> 3. Here null converts to 0 and does the addition: 3 + 0 = 3.
    <li> '3null'. Here null converts to 'null' and does the concatenation: '3' + 'null' = '3null'.
    <li> 4. Here true converts to 1 and does the addition: 1 + 3 = 4.
    <li> 0. Here null converts to 0 and false converts to 0 does the addition: 0 + 0 = 0.
    <li> '3undefined'. Here undefined converts to 'undefined' and does the concatenation: '3' + 'undefined' = '3undefined'.
    <li> NaN. Here '3' - undefined, the answer is still undefined, which becomes NaN.

### 14.
<ol type="A">
    <li> true. String '2' becomes a number 2.
    <li> false. Strings are compared letter-by-letter, since 2 is greater than 1 in "lexicographical‚Äù order, '2' should be greater than '12'.
    <li> true. '2' convert to 2, thus it equals to 2.
    <li> false. Since they have different data types, we directly return false.
    <li> false. true convert to 1, thus it does not equal to 2.
    <li> true. Boolean(2) has boolean data type and value: true, thus they are strictly equal.
    </ol>

&nbsp;
### 15. When comparing values of different types, regular quality operator **==** converts the values(operands) to numbers, while the strict equality operator **===** checks the equality without type conversion. In other words, if a and b are of different types, then a **===** b immediately returns false without an attempt to convert them.

### 17. It will return an array: [2, 4, 6]. Here we are passing in an array: **[1, 2, 3]** and a fucntion **doSomething()** as parameters of **modifyArray()**. Then we pass each element of the given array as a parameter of **doSomething()** and push each return value into a new array. The **doSomething()** function can double the input value and return it, thus each element in the new array is twice as large as the original one. Hence we have **[2, 4, 6]**.
